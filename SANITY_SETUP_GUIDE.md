# Complete Sanity CMS Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview

I've set up the complete Sanity CMS structure for your blog. Here's what's ready:

✅ **Sanity Studio configured** in `/sanity-studio/`
✅ **Complete schema** for posts, authors, categories
✅ **Rich text editor** with images and code blocks
✅ **SEO optimization** built into content types
✅ **Next.js integration** ready to connect

## 📋 Required Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Sanity Account & Project

**You need to complete this step manually:**

1. **Go to [sanity.io](https://sanity.io)**
2. **Create a free account** (GitHub/Google signin recommended)
3. **Create a new project:**
   - Project name: "Personal Blog" (or your choice)
   - Project ID: Note this down (e.g., `abc123xyz`)
   - Dataset: "production"

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

After creating your project, update these files:

**Update `/nextjs-blog/.env.local`:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Update `/nextjs-blog/sanity-studio/.env.local`:**
```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
```

### Step 3: Get API Token

1. In your Sanity project dashboard: https://sanity.io/manage
2. Go to **API** → **Tokens**
3. **Add API token**:
   - Name: "Blog Frontend"
   - Permissions: "Editor"
   - Copy the token and add to `.env.local`

### Step 4: Start Sanity Studio

```bash
cd ~/nextjs-blog/sanity-studio
npm run dev
```

The studio will be available at: **http://localhost:3333**
